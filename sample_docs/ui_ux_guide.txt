ShopSmart Checkout UI and UX Guide

1. Overall layout
   The checkout page uses a two column layout on desktop and a single column layout on mobile. The left column contains cart items and customer details. The right column contains the order summary, shipping options, payment options and the Pay now button.

2. Visual style
   Background color uses a dark theme with near black (#020617 and #0b1120). Text uses light gray (#e5e7eb) with muted labels in #9ca3af. Primary interactive elements like Pay now and the selected state for inputs use an accent green (#22c55e).

3. Key elements and ids
   Page title id: checkout-title
   Order id badge: order-id
   Cart card container: cart-section
   Customer details card: customer-details-card
   Order summary card: order-summary-card
   Discount section container: discount-section
   Shipping card: shipping-card and radio inputs shipping-standard, shipping-express
   Payment card: payment-card and radio inputs payment-card, payment-paypal
   Pay button: pay-now-btn
   Success banner container: payment-success-banner
   Error banner container: payment-error-banner

4. Discount experience
   The discount input field uses id discount-code and the apply button uses id apply-discount-btn. Error or info messages are displayed in the discount-message element. Valid discount codes and their rules are:
   AUTOMATE10 gives 10 percent off subtotal
   AUTOTEST20 gives 20 percent off subtotal
   Discount should not be applied when the code is empty or invalid.

5. Validation and error states
   Required customer fields and their error elements:
   Full name: input full-name, error element error-name
   Email: input email, error element error-email
   Address: input address-line, error element error-address
   Pincode: input pincode, error element error-pincode
   When the Pay now button is clicked, if any required field is empty or invalid, payment-error-banner is displayed with a generic message.

6. Success state
   On a successful payment, payment-success-banner becomes visible. The title element is payment-success-title and the subtitle is payment-success-subtitle. Automation test cases should verify that success banner appears only after all required fields are valid and Pay now is pressed.

7. Accessibility conventions
   Quantity inputs have aria-label text to support automation testing based on accessibility attributes. Buttons and inputs use visible labels that match their function so that text based locators can be used as a fallback in tests.
